Objective 
Today, we're going further with Binary Search Trees. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task 
A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, , pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the levelOrder function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

Hint: You'll find a queue helpful in completing this challenge.

Input Format

The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a BST: 
The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases). 
The  subsequent lines each contain an integer, , denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

Output Format

Print the  value of each node in the tree's level-order traversal as a single line of  space-separated integers.
