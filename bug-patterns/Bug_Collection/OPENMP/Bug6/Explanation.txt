Error due to not using critical section.
In details, in the buggy version:
``````````````````````````````
for (int j =0; j < 10; j++) {
      T[j] +=1;
    }
``````````````````````````````
Since the update of `T` elements in  each iteration is related to each other, `T` needs to be under atomic clause.
