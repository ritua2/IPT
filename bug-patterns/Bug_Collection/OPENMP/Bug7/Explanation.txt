Incorrect specification of storage attributes for the variables used in both serial and parallel regions
In details, in the buggy version:

``````````````````````````````
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i) reduction( + : sum )
``````````````````````````````

Since i is initialized outside of the parallel region and used inside, it needs to be under firstprivate clause not just the private clause.


* Error message

```
buggy_version.c: In function ‘main’:
buggy_version.c:8:11: error: initializer expression refers to iteration variable ‘i’
   #pragma omp parallel for private(i) reduction( + : sum )
           ^~~
```
