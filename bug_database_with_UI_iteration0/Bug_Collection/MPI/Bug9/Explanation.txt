Incorrect usage of Bcast, it needs to be call from all nodes.
In details, in the buggy version:
``````````````````````````````
  if (rank == root) {
    ...
    MPI_Bcast(arr, N, MPI_INT, root, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
  }
``````````````````````````````

This will cause only the root calling the Bcast and create the deadlock since it (the root) needs to wait for Bcast answer from other node.
