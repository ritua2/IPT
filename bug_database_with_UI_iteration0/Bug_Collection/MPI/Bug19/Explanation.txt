Missing Bcast to distributed the array.
In details, in the buggy version:
``````````````````````````````
   if(id==0){
       for(int n=0; n<IN; n++){   //predecided map values
           toMap[n] = rand()%IN;
           mapper[n] = rand()%101;
       }
       printf("\n");
   }
   if(id == 0){
       for(int n=0; n<IN; n++){   //map results
           printf("[%d -> %d]\n", toMap[n], mapper[n]);
       }
   }
   int d = IN/p;
   int i = id*d;
   while(i<id*d+d && i<IN){
        result[i] = mapper[toMap[i]];
        i++;
   }

There is no communication between tasks, therefore the other tasks that are supposed to receive data from root are not perform the calculation correctly.
