Incorrect results. This error is due to incorrect argument value for Allgather.

In the buggy version:

``````````````````````````````
 MPI_Allgather(&c, 1, MPI_LONG, &oldcount, numprocs, MPI_LONG, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
``````````````````````````````

the argument `numprocs` is not wanted here since the field is asking for the number of elements each process would receive.
