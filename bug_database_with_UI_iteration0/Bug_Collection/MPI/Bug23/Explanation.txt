The buggy version may produce segmentation fault on some systems as explained on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47265060/open-mpi-waitall-segmentation-fault :


Several issues:
- Isend passes &resultado several times without waiting until previous non-blocking operation finishes. It is not allowed to reuse the buffer passed to Isend before making sure the operation finishes if correct result is desired.

- The result shouldn't be a simple variable, but an array of size at least (p-1)

- It is not recommended to allocate arrays on stack, like MPI_Request and MPI_Status if the size is not a known small number. In this case the size of array is (p-1), it is better to use malloc for this data structure.

- Use MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE if not checking status.

- Specify number of items (1) instead of sizeof(double).

- The best version is just to use MPI_Gather.
