Dangerous practice with initializing array used in MPI call.
In details, in the buggy version:
``````````````````````````````
 MPI_Scatterv(&txMatrix[0][0], sendcMat, displMat, MPI_INT, &rxMatrix[0][0], sendcMat[rank], MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 ``````````````````````````````
 For other node other than 0, `txMatrix[0][0]`is not previously intinilized. 
 Therefore, txMatrix[0][0] is not intilized in those node causes the MPI_Scatterv to crash.
