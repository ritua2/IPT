The original code had the following syntax error:

* Error message

```
buggy_version.c(21): error: expression must be a modifiable lvalue
          str =  "abcd";        
          ^

compilation aborted for buggy_version.c (code 2)
```

After the aforementioned error is fixed by using the strcpy function in the code, the code compiled but produced run-time erros mentioned below:
```
a?
1 0
bb
2 1
ccc??
3 3
dddd?
