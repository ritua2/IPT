The error occurs because the variable range is of type integer (this is correct), and if 100/size has a remainder, this remainder is not handled correctly. The code should take care of assigning the remainder value after the division (which most probably would be the number of iterations of a loop or the amount of remaining work) amongst the active MPI processes.

In the buggy version:

``````````````````````````````
int range = 100/size;
``````````````````````````````

range variable will not be captured correctly in case size is not divisible by 100.
