The error occurs due to incorrect balancing of the workload, and incorrect order of arguments in MPI_Gatherv.

In the buggy version:

``````````````````````````````
int range = 10/size;
``````````````````````````````

range variable will not be captured correctly in case size is not divisible by 10.
