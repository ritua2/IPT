Error because of incorrect assignment for variale storage attributes.
In details, in the buggy file:
``````````````````````````````
#pragma omp parallel for shared (T,sum) reduction (+ : sum)

  for ( int i = 0; i < 10; i ++) {
    for (int j =0; j < 5; j++) {
      T[j]  = i ;
    }
   	...
  }
``````````````````````````````
Since the array `T` is updated entirely in each iteration, sharing `T` will cause non-determninistic error.
