Error is caused by breaking out of the openmp for loop with a return calls.
In details, in the buggy version:

``````````````````````````````
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 3; i <= static_cast<int>(sqrt(n)); i += 2) {
    if (n % i == 0) return false;
}
``````````````````````````````

This causes crash in the program since openmp does not support this practices.
