Error because of incorrect assignment for variable attributes
In the buggy version:
``````````````````````````````
#pragma omp parallel for shared (i) reduction (+: sum)
``````````````````````````````
The loop index is actually not shared, each OpenMP thread needs to have its own copy of the loop variable so that it knows its start and stop conditions.


* Error message
