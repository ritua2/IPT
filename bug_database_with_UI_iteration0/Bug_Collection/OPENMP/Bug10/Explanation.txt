Using reduction value inside of the reduction for loop.
In details, in the buggy program:

``````````````````````````````
#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+: sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < DATA_MAG; i++)
    {
        sum += H[i];
        ...
    }
``````````````````````````````

Since `sum` is not thread independent, it need to be either computed using atomic/critical section for not under openmp block at all.
