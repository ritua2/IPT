Incorrect specification of storage attributes for the variables used in both serial and parallel regions
In details, in the buggy version:

``````````````````````````````
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i) reduction( + : sum )
``````````````````````````````

Since i is initialized outside of the parallel region and used inside, it needs to be under firstprivate clause not just the private clause.
