Computing shared value without atomic computation.
In details, in the buggy program:

``````````````````````````````
#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+: sum)
    for (int j =0; j < 10; j++) {
      T[j] +=sum;
    }
``````````````````````````````

Since `T` is shared, it need to be either computed using atomic/critical section.
