# Interactive Parallelization Tool (IPT)


The *.zip file named testing_scripts.zip contains 
1) sample serial programs, 
2) parallel versions of the sample programs generated using IPT, 
3) a bash script to test the code correctness, and 
4) sample input files (*.txt)

The core IPT code will be made available shortly under the new BSD license.
