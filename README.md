# Interactive Parallelization Tool (IPT)

This repository contains the IPT binaries, training and testing material related to teaching parallel programming with IPT, link to the repository for the ipt-web code, code for teaching logical errors in parallel programs, and some translator code.

The IPT binary for the Stampede2 system at TACC is available at the following paths:
1) https://github.com/ritua2/IPT/tree/master/PEARC18_OMP

2) https://github.com/ritua2/IPT/tree/master/PEARC18_MPI

The *.zip file named testing_scripts.zip contains 
1) sample serial programs, 
2) parallel versions of the sample programs generated using IPT, 
3) a bash script to test the code correctness, and 
4) sample input files (*.txt)

All the content in this repository has been made available under the new BSD license.

# IPT web-portal 

The code related to the latest version of IPT web (https://iptweb.tacc.utexas.edu) is accesible at:
https://github.com/ritua2/gib

The IPT web portal code can be easily customized for building new gateways (web-portals) for providing both interactive and batch computing modes.

The assets related to the previous version of IPT web are available at the following links:
https://github.com/ritua2/ipt-web
